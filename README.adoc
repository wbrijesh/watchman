= Watchman

== Overview

Watchman is a lightweight logging service designed for personal projects and small teams. 
It offers a simpler alternative to complex open-source solutions like ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. 
and aims to be easy to use and consume as little resources as possible.

I am writing Watchman to meet my own needs, and it is currently under development. I plan on releasing a relatively stable version soon.


== Current limitations:

* Incomplete client library (missing authentication)
* Missing log file rotation and log expiration

== Installation Instructions:

Running Watchman can be as simple as running "go run main.go", but if you want to
run it as intended, you should follow the instructions at link:./Installation.adoc[Installation.adoc] file.
