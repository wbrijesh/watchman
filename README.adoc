== Overview

Watchman is a hacky small scale logging tool for my personal projects kind of like that art you made in kindergarden (awesome, but not exactly museum worthy).

i wrote this purely for my own amusement, since it doesn't even have basic auth, this project is strictly a "don't try this at home" situation.

Maybe someday I'll get around to adding auth, but even then, this is best used with toy projects.
